    <h4>8/25/2023:</h3>
    <p Class=normaltext>Today, we played a game called marble pass. In the game, we had to pass the marble along through pipes from person to person. There were a few rules though. We weren't alound to overlap the pipes and each person had to hold one of the pipes to help move the marble. It took a few tries to get into the rythym of things and to keep the marble on track, but eventually we were able to get it into the bucket at the end. Our team in the class ending up winning the challenge. This was the main activity today. After we did this activity, we just spent time working on and updating the website. Overall it was fun and I would gladdly do it again.</p>

    <h4>8/28/23:</h4>
    <p Class=normaltext>Today, we learned about some of the basic principles of mechanical engineering. We learned about the simple machines that make up all different types of mechanical systems. All in all, though, we didnâ€™t do very much since it was a short period because of banking day.</p>

    <p Class=normaltext>Today, we learned about some of the basics of mechanical engineering. We started using CAD software. The CAD software we are using is TinkerCad. CAD software is used to help prototype and design different pieces of a project. TinkerCad is a relatively basic CAD software. It is developed by Autodesk. Autodesk also makes other professional and hobby-grade CAD software. For example, Fusion 360. Using CAD software helps with being able to understand all of the pieces of your project and how they work with each other. Also, using a CAD program can allow the user to prototype and iterate on their design without using materials that cost money. Overall, today I had a lot of fun</P>
