                Today, we played a game called marble pass. In the game, we had to pass the marble along through pipes from person to person. There were a few rules though. We weren't alound to overlap the pipes and each person had to hold one of the pipes to help move the marble. It took a few tries to get into the rythym of things and to keep the marble on track, but eventually we were able to get it into the bucket at the end. Our team in the class ending up winning the challenge. This was the main activity today. After we did this activity, we just spent time working on and updating the website. Overall it was fun and I would gladdly do it again.

                Today, we learned about some of the basics of mechanical engineering. We started using CAD software. The CAD software we are using is TinkerCad. CAD software is used to help prototype and design different pieces of a project. TinkerCad is a relatively basic CAD software. It is developed by Autodesk. Autodesk also makes other professional and hobby-grade CAD software. For example, Fusion 360. Using CAD software helps with being able to understand all of the pieces of your project and how they work with each other. Also, using a CAD program can allow the user to prototype and iterate on their design without using materials that cost money. Overall, today I had a lot of fun

                Today, we started designing out Rube Goldberg machines. We are working in teems of four people each. Along with starting to design our Rube Goldberg machine, we held the contest for the best beginning CAD design. A couple days ago, when we designed our first CAD project, out teacher said that we would have a competiton to find the best one.

                This week, we started working on the designs for our Rube Goldberg machines. At first our team started planning it out on a piece of paper. After that, we were able to start designing it in a 3d environment using TinkerCad. Using TinkerCad we were able to make a full model of our design for the machine. We used many different simple machines in our design. When we finished the basic design in TinkerCad, we were able to start building the machine. We didn't get very far in the building process because we didn't have enough time. This is what we did this week. Below is a screenshot of our CAD design.

                This week, we continued out computer engineering unit. As part of this unit, we desconstructed a desktop computer and then put it back together. This allowed us to see how the different components worked together and what they did. It was very interesting to see how to build a computer. Disecting computers was a very interesting experience and I would love to do it again. After we took it apart and put it back together, we plugged the computer into power and a display to see if it worked. Our computer powered on, but didn't fully boot up most likely because it didn't have RAM or storage. This is what we did this week.

                This week, we started our bioengineering unit. In this unit, we learned about all of the applications of other kinds of engineering in bioengineering. We learned how people are able to create devices that recreate the motion and likeness of natural things, like human arms, legs, or anything else. As a project, we created a prosthetic hand. The hand had to be able to be operated and controlled. It also had to be able to pick up and empty pastic water bottle. This project was fun and it was even more Overall, this week was fun. This unit was quite short compared to all of the others but I still enjoyed it.

            <p>Over these past two weeks, we designed, built, and tested bottle rockets. During the design phase, we used TinkerCAD to design the rocket. We tried to design it in a way that would allow it to fly straight. It didn't really work, but it still went relatively far. In the air, it did a backflip spraying me in the face. I was trying to avoid that, but it didn't work. If I ever do this again, hopefully I can create a better design that will go further and fly longer. Overall, I enjoyed this project and the unit in general. I was fun to be able to build a rocket that we could actually launch. There is a video below of the actual launch.</p>

                Today, we created filters out of sand, small rocks, big rocks, and cotton balls. The filters were able to filter out dirty, muddy water into relatively clean water. The filter that I built did relatively well. It was able to filter the disgusting looking water into a yellow-ish, mountain-dew looking colored water. I still wouldn't drink it, but it made it look cleaner. As we built and tested the filters, I started to notice that if we just used the raw materials, the water would come out looking dirtier for some reason. I then had the idea to wash the large and small rocks to help get some of the pre-existing dirt off of them. This helped filter the water to a cleaner level that it previously had been. This is what we did this week.

                This week we started our electrical engineering unit. We learned about the different kinds of electrical components like resistors, capacitors, diodes, power sources, etc. We also started designing circuits in a program called TinkerCAD. We've used TinkerCAD in the passed for the Mechanical Engineering unit, but it also has a circuit designer. We have to drag and drop components together or connect them with the built in wires. Once we built the circuits on a breadboard (a way to distrubite power and build circuits for prototyping) we could then press the simulation button to see how the electricity would run through the circuit and whether or not it would blow up components or give possible damage to anything. This is what we did this week, and I very much enjoyed learning the basics. Next week we are supposed to start learning the more indepth parts of electrical engineering.

                This week we continued our electrical engineering unit. We built circuits on breadboards that lit up LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes). At first, we used an Arduino, a small computer, just as power for the circuits, but later in the week we used it to program things for the LEDs to do. We had to connect the power,resistors, LEDs, and ground in a certain order for things to work properly. We were able to make the LEDs flash using the Arduino, create a sequence of lights, and even make it fade on and off. The Arduino programming IDE used C which is a quite a old programming language. It was interesting to see the differences between a programming language that was developed a long time ago and things that were created recently. Overall, this week was very fun and I am excited to see what we are going to do next.

                This week, we worked on the business engineering unit. This unit involved many things including marketing and user experience. This unit was very interesting because it involved many of the behind the scenes things that happen while users of products are just living their lives. In my opinion, buisness engineering isnt's as interesting as something like mechanical engineering, but I think that it is very usful in the day-to-day world because it used in many different aspects of the economy. Overall, I think that this was a fun unit. Below is an image made in a 3D software called Blender.

                This week, we started and basically finished the chemical engineering unit. As a project for this unit we made oobleck. There is a video below of moving a popsicle stick through it. Oobleck is made by combining cornstarch and water. Oobleck is a non-Newtonian fluid meaning that it acts like a solid under a lot of force and like a liquid when it is under very little force.

                Over these past couple weeks we started a project in which we make an arduino car. At first, we had to make a proposal for the project. In these proposal we had to include a bill of materials or BOM. We also had to include a plan for the project. In this plan, we had to document on how we wanted to spend out weeks doing this project. After we finished that proprosal, we started a sketch. This sketch had to include dimensions for the car and all of its parts. After we finished the sketch, we were able to import it into a CAD software, in this case Fudion 360 made by Autodesk. In Fusion 360, we were able to make the design 3d. From this design on the computer, I was able to print it on my 3d printer. This made an exact replica of the my model on the computer. Soon we will start building the car. We have also designed the circuitry and finished the coding for the project. Hopefully it works on the first try, even if it doesn't we will continue iterating and improving the design.

                These past couple weeks, we have been working on our car projects. We chose to build an arduino car. We got the car working and it was able to turn around objects and avoid them. We did this by using ultrasonic distance sensors. This allowed us to see how far away from the car objects around it were. At first, we used two distance sensors. Using these two data points, we were able to determine if we had to turn left or if we had to turn right. This provided us with full obstacle avoidness abilities. Later, we took off one of the sensore and edited the code so that it worked with only one sensor. We did this by making it so that if the sensor detected something within a certain distance, the car would automatically turn left. This means that the car couldn't turn right at all. After we got the car working and added all of the features, we decided to rewire the whole car to make it easier to follow where all of the wires go. Once we rewired it though, the car wasn't working. This is as far as we have gotten, but hopefully we can get it working. This is what we have been doing over these past couple of weeks.

                These past few weeks, we have been building an Arduino car that we programmed to avoid obstacles. In the end, we got the C++ code to work and the car was able to avoid obstacles in a relatively good way. You can look at some of the previous updates to learn more about the process of making the arduino car. Overall though, my groupmate and I used Fusion 360 to model and CAD the car. This allowed us to make an extremely accurate model of the car that we wanted to create. We were able to use the TinkerCad circuit designer to create a test some code before we started building the actual car. This allowed use to figure out waht resources that we needed to finish the car. Once we had the design for everything figured out, we 3d printed the model that we had previously designed. 3d printing the design, allowed to create a 1:1 recreation of what we designed on the computer. Using this 3d print, we were able to start building the electronics on top of it. The electronics that we used include 2 DC motors, an Arduino Uno, a L293D motor driver IC, a prototyping breadboard, an ultrasonic distance sensor, and lots of jumper cables for the breadboard. The breadboard acted as a way to connect all of the compents together. Using the arduino, we could hook up to the motor driver which took in a low voltage signal and used it to modulate a higher voltage connection to each of the motors. We were able to hook up the ultrasonic distance sensor to the Arduino, this allowed to know how far from an object we were. Using this information, we could figure out when to turn by comaring the distance detected by the sensor to a set limit that we created. For example, if the distance was closer than 5 centimeters, the car backed up, if it was closer than 15 centimeters it turned left, otherwise, the car turned left. Using all of these thing combined, we were able to create a car that could detect obstacles and avoid them. Overall, I had a lot of fun with this project. Below is a video of the car driving and attempting to avoid obstacles.

                This past week, we started a new project. This project is an egg drop. That means that we have to build a contraption that is able to protect an egg through 3 story drop. We are planning to build and trash bag with paper, cotton, and other assorted soft items. These items will help protect the egg that will be placed inside the bag at the top. Because of all of the soft materials, they egg's momentum will hopefully be reduced and dampened. If these materials weren't there, the egg would most likely break on impact, but with them, the egg has a chance of surviving the drop. There is both sketch and render/CAD of our design below. Overall, this project seems like quite a lot of fun so far.

                This past week have been designing and building a egg drop contraption. This contraption had to be able to safely protect an egg from the forces of dropping it off of a two story balcony. This means that id had to be able to distrubite the forces form the landing away from the egg inside and dispate thme in a way that was safe to both the contraption and the egg. The designed we used was very similar to a pillow. We did have to make a few modifications to the pillow design because we believed that it would word better if we did. We built a structure made of straws and put it inside of the a trashbag filled with paper. This structure made sure that the egg would stay in the middle of the paper and trashbag pillow meaning that it was protected from all sides. This meant that our design worked extremely well. Our teacher was even able to throw it around like a ball a couple of times after we had dropped it and the egg still survived. We decided to add a parachute on top just incase to keep the project in the orientation that we wanted it to land in. There are two images of our design below along with a video of it being dropped. The writing on the egg says 243 quintillion doors which is a refernce to one of our previous projects in which we tried to calculate the total number of doors at the school and whether there were more doors or wheels. We calculated 243 quintillion dorrs as a rough esitmate due to the input and output channels in the body that are able to open and close to regulate protein sharing. This project was extremely fun and interesting and it was fun to see how the other designs worked compared to ours (most of the other designs were also able to perfectly protect the egg).

                This week, we designed and built a boat that could fit in a gutter and be propeled by the 4 big breaths of air. Our design was a small hollow rectangle made out of paper with toothpicks taped on to hold up a paper sail. Using this design and 4 extremely large breaths our small boat was able to travel 240 cm in a 8cm in diameter

                Last week, we started working on a contraption that will be able to carry a fully filled water balloon 100m on the end of a yard stick. The only materials that we were allowed to use were popsicle sticks and rubber bands. This mean that we had to be resourcefull with how we used these items. Eventually, we came up with a design that has rubber bands holding popsicle sticks around the balloon, we then use those same rubber bands from the beginning to hold the whole assembly on to the yard stick. Hopefully this will be able to safely and securely hold the waterballon on the stick for the entire 100m. This week, we are going to go down to the track and test our contraption. I really hope that the yard stick doesn't snap. This is what we have been doing for the week.

                This week, we made a project proposal for a boat that can go across the school pool, to the end and back. We made a CAD model and did some calculations to figure out the design of the boat and how big it had to be. We calculated for a certain amount of weight (about 250 lbs) how much water need to be displaced to keep the boat afloat. We calculated that out boat had to be about 4ish feet long and about 3ish feet wide. We needed to displace this much because the team members in the boat have a combined weight of about 220 lbs and we estimated that the boat would weigh around 20-30 lbs. All of these will hopefully allow the boat to be paddled across the pool without breaking.

                This week, we finished building out boat. I believe that based off the structural integritity and all of the calculations that we did, our boat will be able to make it the whole distance across the pool. Hopefully, our boat can make it without our teammates having to swim any of the distance.

                This week we tested the boat in the school pool. Our boat made it about 80% of the distance that it needed to until it sank. Our design was good except for the fact the walls were a little low and water was gettings splashed into the boat meaning that the cardboard was getting wet from both sides which made it fall apart even faster.
