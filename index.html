    <p>Today, we played a game called marble pass. In the game, we had to pass the marble along through pipes from person to person. There were a few rules though. We weren't alound to overlap the pipes and each person had to hold one of the pipes to help move the marble. It took a wer tries to get into the rythym of things and to keep the marble on track, but eventually we were able to get it into the bucket at the end. Our team in the class ending up winning the challenge. Overall it was fun and I would gladdly do it again.</p>
