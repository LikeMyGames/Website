    <h4>8/25/2023:</h3>
    <p>Today, we played a game called marble pass. In the game, we had to pass the marble along through pipes from person to person. There were a few rules though. We weren't alound to overlap the pipes and each person had to hold one of the pipes to help move the marble. It took a few tries to get into the rythym of things and to keep the marble on track, but eventually we were able to get it into the bucket at the end. Our team in the class ending up winning the challenge. This was the main activity today. After we did this activity, we just spent time working on and updating the website. Overall it was fun and I would gladdly do it again.</p>

    <h4>8/28/23:</h4>
    <p>Today, we learned about some of the basic principles of mechanical engineering. We learned about the simple machines that make up all different types of mechanical systems. All in all, though, we didnâ€™t do very much since it was a short period because of banking day.</p>

    <h4>8/30/23:</h4>
    <p>Today, we learned about some of the basics of mechanical engineering. We started using CAD software. The CAD software we are using is TinkerCad. CAD software is used to help prototype and design different pieces of a project. TinkerCad is a relatively basic CAD software. It is developed by Autodesk. Autodesk also makes other professional and hobby-grade CAD software. For example, Fusion 360. Using CAD software helps with being able to understand all of the pieces of your project and how they work with each other. Also, using a CAD program can allow the user to prototype and iterate on their design without using materials that cost money. Overall, today I had a lot of fun</P>

    <h4>9/1/23:</h4>
    <p>Today, we started designing out Rube Goldberg machines. We are working in teems of four people each. Along with starting to design our Rube Goldberg machine, we held the contest for the best beginning CAD design. A couple days ago, when we designed our first CAD project, out teacher said that we would have a competiton to find the best one. </p>

    <h4>9/3/23 - 9/9/23</h4>
    <p>This week, we started working on the designs for our Rube Goldberg machines. At first our team started planning it out on a piece of paper. After that, we were able to start designing it in a 3d environment using TinkerCad. Using TinkerCad we were able to make a full model of our design for the machine. We used many different simple machines in our design. When we finished the basic design in TinkerCad, we were able to start building the machine. We didn't get very far in the building process because we didn't have enough time. This is what we did this week. Below is a screenshot of our CAD design.</p>
