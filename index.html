                Today, we played a game called marble pass. In the game, we had to pass the marble along through pipes from person to person. There were a few rules though. We weren't alound to overlap the pipes and each person had to hold one of the pipes to help move the marble. It took a few tries to get into the rythym of things and to keep the marble on track, but eventually we were able to get it into the bucket at the end. Our team in the class ending up winning the challenge. This was the main activity today. After we did this activity, we just spent time working on and updating the website. Overall it was fun and I would gladdly do it again.

                Today, we learned about some of the basic principles of mechanical engineering. We learned about the simple machines that make up all different types of mechanical systems. All in all, though, we did not do very much since it was a short period because of banking day.</p>

                Today, we learned about some of the basics of mechanical engineering. We started using CAD software. The CAD software we are using is TinkerCad. CAD software is used to help prototype and design different pieces of a project. TinkerCad is a relatively basic CAD software. It is developed by Autodesk. Autodesk also makes other professional and hobby-grade CAD software. For example, Fusion 360. Using CAD software helps with being able to understand all of the pieces of your project and how they work with each other. Also, using a CAD program can allow the user to prototype and iterate on their design without using materials that cost money. Overall, today I had a lot of fun

                Today, we started designing out Rube Goldberg machines. We are working in teems of four people each. Along with starting to design our Rube Goldberg machine, we held the contest for the best beginning CAD design. A couple days ago, when we designed our first CAD project, out teacher said that we would have a competiton to find the best one.

                This week, we started working on the designs for our Rube Goldberg machines. At first our team started planning it out on a piece of paper. After that, we were able to start designing it in a 3d environment using TinkerCad. Using TinkerCad we were able to make a full model of our design for the machine. We used many different simple machines in our design. When we finished the basic design in TinkerCad, we were able to start building the machine. We didn't get very far in the building process because we didn't have enough time. This is what we did this week. Below is a screenshot of our CAD design.

                This week, we finished our cardboard rube goldberg machine. We might have made our machine too complicated but we eventually got it working. Below is a video of the project. On Friday, we also started to learn about computer engineering. Computer engineering includes electrical engineering and computer science. This is what we learned this week.

                This week, we continued out computer engineering unit. As part of this unit, we desconstructed a desktop computer and then put it back together. This allowed us to see how the different components worked together and what they did. It was very interesting to see how to build a computer. Disecting computers was a very interesting experience and I would love to do it again. After we took it apart and put it back together, we plugged the computer into power and a display to see if it worked. Our computer powered on, but didn't fully boot up most likely because it didn't have RAM or storage. This is what we did this week.

                This week, we started our bioengineering unit. In this unit, we learned about all of the applications of other kinds of engineering in bioengineering. We learned how people are able to create devices that recreate the motion and likeness of natural things, like human arms, legs, or anything else. As a project, we created a prosthetic hand. The hand had to be able to be operated and controlled. It also had to be able to pick up and empty pastic water bottle. This project was fun and it was even more Overall, this week was fun. This unit was quite short compared to all of the others but I still enjoyed it.

            <p>Over these past two weeks, we designed, built, and tested bottle rockets. During the design phase, we used TinkerCAD to design the rocket. We tried to design it in a way that would allow it to fly straight. It didn't really work, but it still went relatively far. In the air, it did a backflip spraying me in the face. I was trying to avoid that, but it didn't work. If I ever do this again, hopefully I can create a better design that will go further and fly longer. Overall, I enjoyed this project and the unit in general. I was fun to be able to build a rocket that we could actually launch. There is a video below of the actual launch.</p>

                Today, we created filters out of sand, small rocks, big rocks, and cotton balls. The filters were able to filter out dirty, muddy water into relatively clean water. The filter that I built did relatively well. It was able to filter the disgusting looking water into a yellow-ish, mountain-dew looking colored water. I still wouldn't drink it, but it made it look cleaner. As we built and tested the filters, I started to notice that if we just used the raw materials, the water would come out looking dirtier for some reason. I then had the idea to wash the large and small rocks to help get some of the pre-existing dirt off of them. This helped filter the water to a cleaner level that it previously had been. This is what we did this week.

                This week we started our electical engineering unit. We learned about the different kinds of electrical components like resistors, capacitors, diodes, power sources, etc. We also started designing circuits in a program called TinkerCAD. We've used TinkerCAD in the passed for the Mechanical Engineering unit, but it also has a circuit designer. We have to drag and drop components together or connect them with the built in wires. Once we built the circuits on a breadboard (a way to distrubite power and build circuits for prototyping) we could then press the simulation button to see how the electricity would run through the circuit and whether or not it would blow up components or give possible damage to anything. This is what we did this week, and I very much enjoyed learning the basics. Next week we are supposed to start learning the more indepth parts of electrical engineering.

                This week we continued our electrical engineering unit. We built circuits on breadboards that lit up LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes). At first, we used an Arduino, a small computer, just as power for the circuits, but later in the week we used it to program things for the LEDs to do. We had to connect the power,resistors, LEDs, and ground in a certain order for things to work properly. We were able to make the LEDs flash using the Arduino, create a sequence of lights, and even make it fade on and off. The Arduino programming IDE used C which is a quite a old programming language. It was interesting to see the differences between a programming language that was developed a long time ago and things that were created recently. Overall, this week was very fun and I am excited to see what we are going to do next.
